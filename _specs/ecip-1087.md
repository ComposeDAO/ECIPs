### Abstract

Don't touch Kotti; allow ECIP1061, ECIP1078, and ECIP1086 (EIP2200, EIP2200Disable) to continue as specified and implemented there.

Rollback Mordor to 750000 (3507 block prior to ECIP1061 activation), with ECIP1078 activation at block 778507 (same as ECIP1061).

### Motivation

ECIP1061 specifies a hard fork "Aztlan" for ETC networks. (google it)
ECIP1078 specifies a hard fork "Phoenix" for ETC Networks (discussions here: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/262).

ECIP1061 includes EIP2200.
ECIP1078 disables EIP2200

EIP2200 was incorrectly implemented in ethereum/go-ethereum, etclabscore/multi-geth, multi-geth/multi-geth, and paritytech/parityethereum clients, which together compose the lion's share of ETC network providership.
EIP2200 has since been (simply) corrected (in all impacted providers AFAIK).

ECIP1061 and ECIP1078 have equal activation block numbers on mainnet.
But, ECIP1061 has already been activated on testnets, while ECIP1078, with a later testnet activation values, is not yet enabled on testnets.

This means that an incorrect implementation of EIP2200 is live on testnets.
This means that protocol providers publishing releasing which include ECIP1078 for testnets are faced with a dilemma:

- Don't correct EIP2200 before the testnets ECIP1078 fork.
- Do correct EIP2200 before the fork, but follow specification (ECIP1086) to "allow" the incorrect EIP2200 implementation.
- Do correct EIP2200 before the fork, but rollback the effected testnets to "reset" prior to the impact of the incorrect EIP2200 implementation.

There seem to be two major, sometimes contradictory, philosophies about ETC testnets.

A. Testnets are a public service; a place for ETC-based dapp developers to try out their stuff in public.
B. Testnets are a public test; a place to demonstrate network feature acceptance before equivalent changes risk actual value on ETC mainnet.

### Specification

Accept and include ECIP1086 on Kotti testnet. It's a PoA network, so it doesn't mirror ETC mainnet in the first place since it uses different consensus rules.

Change Mordor testnet ECIP1078 activation number to 778507. This will place ECIP1061 and ECIP1078 activation at equal blocks, and they will activate simulaneously, just like they are scheduled to on mainnet.
Reset Mordor testnet back to block 775000 (3507 blocks prior to its ECIP1061 -- and, as proposed, ECIP1078 -- activation).

### Rationale

This allows one testnet (Kotti, the one already consensus-different from mainnet) to continue as an unedited public resource, and the other (Mordor, the Proof of Work one) to simulate the feature and feature-activation behavior of mainnet equivalently.
