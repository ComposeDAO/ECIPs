### Abstract

### Motivation

### Specification

Topics:

A. Wallets & Ethereum Name Service
B. Enhanced Nakamoto Consensus
C. Best Development Experience
D. Round out ETC Ecosystem (Infura, Alchemy, etc. equivalence)
E. Improve ETC inter-chain value with other EVM and non-EVM systems through composition
F. Improve concurrency of EVM using modern computer science techniques

Initiatives

1. Align ETC Wallet(s) with other HDW compatible wallets (incl. ETH)
2. Make ECIPs congruent with Nakamoto Consensus compatible EIPS
3. Create a developer friendly ETC mining node environment that is fully documented (using Rust/NixOS)
4. Adopt ETH toolchain to ETC (e.g. HardHat, Foundry, Open Zeppelin, etc.)
5. Experiment and test alternative Nakamoto Consensus systems that are more energy efficient and provably fair
6. Implement cross-chain framework using EVM compatible chains using checkpointed state
7. Redesign EVM for concurrency & scalability with formalized mapping for primitives against a Pi/Rho-like calculus

### Rationale



### Implementation

Implementation for the above initiatives will be detailed in additional ECIPs after the community reaches consensus on this approach and rationale.
